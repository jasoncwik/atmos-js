To install on your Atmos system:

1) unzip the archive

2) ensure you have Java installed and on your path (type "java -version" in a shell or command window to verify)

3) in a shell or command window go to the folder where you unzipped the files.  Use the upload script to upload/install
   the browser on Atmos (you will need your credentials).

   On Windows:
   upload.bat main.html /remote/path/to/install

   On OSX:
   upload.sh main.html /remote/path/to/install

   The script will prompt you for Atmos connection details (including your credentials).  When it completes, it will
   print out a long URL.  This is the public URL for the browser.

4) Copy the URL and paste it into a web browser.  You should be prompted for credentials.  Once you enter them, you should
   see the root directory of the Atmos namespace.
