To install on your Atmos system:

1) unzip the archive

2) ensure you have Java installed and on your path (type "java -version" in a shell or command window to verify)

3) in a shell or command window go to the folder where you unzipped the files.  Use the upload script to upload/install
   the browser on Atmos (you will need your credentials).

   On Windows:
   upload.bat main.html /remote/path/to/install

   On OSX:
   upload.sh main.html /remote/path/to/install

   The script will prompt you for Atmos connection details (including your credentials).  When it completes, it will
   print out a long URL.  This is the public URL for the browser.

4) Copy the URL and paste it into a web browser.  You should be prompted for credentials.  Once you enter them, you should
   see the root directory of the Atmos namespace.

Release Notes:

1.0.3

Integrated Crypto AES libraries into atmos-min.js and fixed bug where multiple metadata properties were being
concatenated into one.

1.0.2

Stores credentials in user-data (using HTML5 local storage API).  The secret key is AES encrypted first.  If credentials
are stored, the browser will use them and bypass the credentials screen.  You can change your credentials at any time
using the link in the top-right.

1.0.1

Updated Atmos JS binding to 2.0.2 (fixes bugs in error processing of form posts).

1.0.0

This is the first official release of the Atmos HTML5 browser.  It currently works in all major browsers except IE <10.
In the coming weeks, an Atmos hot fix (for 2.0.x) will be released that will add support for IE8+.  IE6 is not currently
supported.
