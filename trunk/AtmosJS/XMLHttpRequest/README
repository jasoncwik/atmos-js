Wrapper for built-in http.js to emulate the browser XMLHttpRequest object.

This can be used with JS designed for browsers to improve reuse of code and allow the use of existing libraries.

Usage: var XMLHttpRequest = require("XMLHttpRequest").XMLHttpRequest and use per W3C specs.

*TODO*

SSL support
Basic authentication
Additional unit tests
Possibly move from http to tcp for more flexibility
